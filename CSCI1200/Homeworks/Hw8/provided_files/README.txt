TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

I used GDB extensively and would write out trees on scrap paper. I would make sure my code
is actually doing what I need it to when working along with the simulator provided. I tried to
make different cases for the recursivesplit which would take into account the different versions
of split we have.
