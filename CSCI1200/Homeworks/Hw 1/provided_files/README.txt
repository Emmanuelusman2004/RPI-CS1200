MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Hello! My names Emmanuel Usman. So I know I didnt do full justify completely
and that I basically tried to milk points for full justify by copying and pasting
the right justify code under the boolean for full justify. However, Here is my
attempt at pseudo-coding the full justify part. I couldn't really think of a way 
to do it and I was really burnt out since I've been coding since 10 am...

list of variables I need:
1. # of spots between words
2. length of all characters w/o space
3. a variable that is the extra spaces (width - length of characters)
4. a variable that finds the number of spaces betwen each line
5. a variable that has the remainder number of spaces using the modulo operator

what i would do with this is create a vector with vectors containing all the words in a specific line
then within the vector with the lines i would try and iterate through and add the spaces inbetween using
pushback but im not sure how. after that iterate through all the strings and create a vector with
the lines with spaces. Afterwards, I would just output to file just like i did in the other cases.

also i know i didnt use functions I didnt really know how to make a function.
